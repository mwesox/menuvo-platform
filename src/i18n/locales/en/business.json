		"title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
		"subtitle": "Everything you need to know about Menuvo",
		"items": [
			{
				"question": "How quickly can I start using Menuvo?",
				"answer": "You can start in under 5 minutes! Register, upload your menu (as PDF or photo), and our AI assistant automatically creates your digital menu. Then you can immediately receive orders."
			},
			{
				"question": "How does the AI menu assistant work?",
				"answer": "Simply upload a photo or PDF of your current menu. Our AI automatically recognizes dishes, prices, and descriptions and creates your digital menu from them. You can adjust and edit everything afterwards."
			},
			{
				"question": "Are there really no commissions?",
				"answer": "No, absolutely no commissions! Unlike Lieferando (13-30% commission) or Wolt (15-30% commission), you keep 100% of your revenue with Menuvo. You only pay a transparent monthly fee – the Starter plan is completely free."
			},
			{
				"question": "Does Menuvo save time for my team?",
				"answer": "Yes. Guests order themselves via smartphone – no calls, no checkout queues. Your service or counter staff has more time for what matters: preparing food, serving guests, and maintaining quality, instead of taking orders."
			},
			{
				"question": "How does Menuvo help me make more revenue?",
				"answer": "Your digital menu automatically suggests matching sides, drinks, and desserts. This makes cross-selling standard – without any additional effort from your team. Many small additional sales per order quickly add up to more monthly revenue."
			},
			{
				"question": "Do I need technical knowledge?",
				"answer": "Not at all! Menuvo is specifically developed for restaurant owners who have no technical knowledge. Everything runs through an intuitive interface – if you can use WhatsApp, you can use Menuvo."
			},
			{
				"question": "How do customers access my ordering system?",
				"answer": "You receive a QR code that you can put on your tables or display in your restaurant. Customers scan the code with their smartphone and can order immediately – without downloading an app."
			},
			{
				"question": "Is Menuvo GDPR compliant?",
				"answer": "Yes, 100%! All data is hosted in Germany and subject to German data protection law. We are fully GDPR compliant and your customer data belongs exclusively to you."
			},
			{
				"question": "Can I use Menuvo for multiple locations?",
				"answer": "Yes! With the Professional plan, you can manage multiple locations. Each location has its own menu, prices, and order management – all centrally through one dashboard."
			},
			{
				"question": "How does support work?",
				"answer": "Starter plan: Email support within 24 hours. Professional plan: Priority support with response within 4 hours. Max plan: Personal account manager and direct phone support."
