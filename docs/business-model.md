# Menuvo Business Model

## The Opportunity

**In Germany, there's no cheap, standalone QR ordering system.**

- **SumUp QR** (Germany) = Payment only. Customer types amount manually. No menu, no ordering.
- **SumUp Order & Pay** = Requires SumUp POS hardware. Not standalone.
- **orderbird / ready2order** = Full POS systems. €29-99/month + hardware.
- **Lieferando / Wolt** = 13-30% commission. They own your customers.

**The gap**: Restaurants that want QR ordering without buying a new POS system.

---

## Positioning

> **"Scan. Bestellen. Bezahlen."**
> (Scan. Order. Pay.)

**SumUp QR** = Customer scans, types amount, pays
**Menuvo** = Customer scans, sees menu, orders, pays → order goes to kitchen

Completely different products.

---

## Strategy

**Zero monthly fees. Just 2.9% per order.**

No subscription, no setup fees, no commitment. Restaurants pay only when they make money.

---

## Pricing

| Fee             | Amount         |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Setup           | €0             |
| Monthly         | €0             |
| Transaction fee | 2.9% per order |

Payment processing (Mollie) is separate and passed through at cost (~2% for cards).

| Lieferando         | Yes     | Yes      | Yes     | No      | Yes            |
| **Menuvo**         | **Yes** | **Yes**  | **Yes** | **Yes** | **Yes**        |

### Pricing Comparison

| Platform              | Monthly | Transaction | What you get               |
|-----------------------|---------|-------------|----------------------------|
| SumUp QR              | €0      | 1.9%        | Payment only               |
| SumUp POS + Order&Pay | €29-99  | 2.5%        | Full POS + ordering        |
| orderbird             | €29-99  | ~2%         | Full POS                   |
| Lieferando            | €0      | 13-30%      | Ordering + their customers |
| **Menuvo**            | **€0**  | **2.9%**    | **Ordering + payment**     |

### Where Menuvo Wins

| Scenario                                | Why Menuvo                      |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| "I have a POS, just want online orders" | Works alongside existing setup  |
| "I don't want monthly fees"             | Only pay when you earn          |
| "I want to be live today"               | AI menu import, 5 minutes setup |
| "I'm a food truck / pop-up"             | No hardware, no commitment      |
| "Lieferando takes too much"             | 2.9% vs 13-30%                  |

## Why This Model

### For Restaurants

- **Zero risk** — no monthly fee if business is slow
- **Easy yes** — "it's free" removes objections
- **Fair** — we earn only when you earn
- **No lock-in** — works with existing POS, cancel anytime

### For Menuvo

- **Low friction acquisition** — easier to get first customers
- **Aligned incentives** — our success = their success
- **Scales automatically** — revenue grows with order volume

## Our Edge

| Advantage              | vs. Competition                                                       |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **AI menu import**     | Upload PDF/photo → live in 5 minutes. Others require manual entry.    |
| **Zero monthly fee**   | No subscription risk. SumUp/orderbird charge €29-99/month.            |
| **Standalone**         | Works without buying new POS. SumUp Order&Pay needs their POS.        |
| **Full ordering**      | Menu + cart + payment + kitchen. SumUp QR is payment-only in Germany. |
| **Low cost structure** | Solo founder. Profitable at 20 restaurants.                           |

---

## The Pitch (German)

> **"QR-Bestellung ohne neues Kassensystem."**
> (QR ordering without a new POS system.)

> **"Bei SumUp tippt der Kunde den Betrag selbst ein. Bei Menuvo wählt er aus der Speisekarte — und die Bestellung
landet direkt in der Küche."**
> (With SumUp, the customer types the amount. With Menuvo, they choose from the menu — and the order goes straight to
> the kitchen.)
